It's time for a new website, and **a new philosophy behind my website**.

Yes, **I’ve had personal websites** before—not just one or two, but quite a few, each with its own story. My first website was pure HTML, no CSS, built when I was 12. It’s probably still floating around on some free web hosting provider. Later, in middle school IT class, I created more advanced websites using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

As I got deeper into tech, my websites evolved. I moved away from basic markup and minimal JS to powerful content management systems like WordPress and Ghost. And honestly, they’re amazing—the ease of use, the great designs, the countless plugins. It’s a no-brainer to use them for a website. **But this time, I wanted to take a different approach.**

I know how to set up and maintain servers, install a CMS, optimize for search engines—you name it. So getting a full-featured website up and running wouldn’t be a big deal. But then I had to ask myself: **What’s the actual purpose of my website? How often will I really update it or write blog posts?**

After thinking about it, **I realized I don’t need much.** I just want **a clean front page** with a short bio, **a nice picture of me** (or at least the best image I can find that coincidentally looks a bit like me. Blog post on that coming soon…), **a few subpages** to showcase my skills, a simple CV, **a contact page**, and maybe **a small blog.** That’s it.

**For something this simple, a CMS like WordPress or Ghost would be overkill**—too much setup, too much maintenance. **A personal website should be a reflection of who you are**, not a complex project that requires constant attention. For people like me, who enjoy keeping things minimal and aren’t trying to be famous, **this is more than enough.**

At one point, I even considered using a modern framework, but then I thought, **“Why overcomplicate it?”** I just wanted something **simple, lightweight, and good-looking.** That’s why I decided to go with a static site generator, specifically **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io).** It generates plain HTML and CSS, avoiding unnecessary bloat and fancy JavaScript.

**Don’t get me wrong—JS and modern frameworks are great**, and I’ve used them plenty. But for this particular project, they’re just unnecessary. So, this approach makes the most sense to me.

I hope that gives you **a better understanding of why I built my site this way.** Feel free to reach out if you have any questions—or if you have any suggestions for improvement!
