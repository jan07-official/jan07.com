I get asked a lot about my IT skillsâ€”whether it's by friends, family, former teachers, or during job interviews (especially when I was applying for apprenticeships). Almost every time, after going through my application, recruiters would say something like, **"Wow, that's a lot for your age! How do you know so much already?"**

And well, even in my personal life, people are often surprised by what I can doâ€”like when I help them with what, to me, are really simple problems. You know, the classics: replacing printer cartridges or getting an app to work again on their phone. When they ask me how I did it, I tend to throw around IT jargon without thinking, and most of the time, they just look at me confused and ask, **"How are you this good at such a young age?"**

Since Iâ€™d like to give everyone a little insight into what I can do, hereâ€™s a small overview of my skills. And as Iâ€™ve mentioned many times on my little website, feel free to reach out if you have any questions regarding my skills or if I can help you out with anything! ðŸ™ƒ

### Conclusion:
#
**Am I the best, most tech-savvy person out there?**

- Definitely not (Iâ€™ve never claimed to be, and I never will)!

**Am I good at what I do, and am I proud of it?**

Yes, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m quite competent at what I do, and Iâ€™m grateful for the knowledge and skills Iâ€™ve been fortunate to acquire.

**Am I humble about it and not just showing off?**

Absolutely (Iâ€™m not the best, and I probably never will be. When I donâ€™t know something or make a mistake, I truly appreciate learning from others with more experience).

**Should we stop all this moral preaching?**

Yes, but itâ€™s important to me to share my perspective and get my point across.
